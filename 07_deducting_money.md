# Deduct the money

[Back to the challenge map](README.md)

By now you have a card that can hold a balance and be topped up. However, unless we can use it to spend money it's not of much use. We should also have a mechanism for deducting money from it.

Write the `deduct` method that will reduce the balance by a specified amount using test-driven approach.

```
In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need my fare deducted from my card
```

## Learning Objectives covered
- Create a simple RSpec test

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [ ] Write a test for the `deduct` method, see it fail
- [ ] Implement the method, see the test pass
