# Create RSpec conventional files

[Back to the challenge map](README.md)

In the previous step, you added `rspec` to your Gemfile. You will be using the RSpec testing framework to test-drive your code throughout this project, so it's important we prepare the project to use RSpec.

Prepare your project for RSpec by creating a helper file and an empty test file. Assume that the name of the class under test that you will create later is `Oystercard`.

## Learning Objectives covered
- Change into directory
- List directory contents
- Create RSpec conventional files
- Create empty files using the command line

## Interview questions you may expect:
- Explain RSpec file and folders naming conventions.
- What do default options in RSpec configuration file mean?
- What do `..` and `.` shortcuts in the command line mean?

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Generate conventional files (helper and config) for an RSpec project using a command-line option of the rspec executable file
- [ ] Follow RSpec naming convention for files and folders
- [ ] Create a test file for the Oystercard class without any tests but with a `describe` block (doesn't exist yet)
